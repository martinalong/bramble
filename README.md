## Bramble

Doctor's office apps have dramatically improved the healthcare experience for patients of companies like One Medical and Forward. However, the vast majority of doctors offices are small practices that cannot reasonably afford to develop an app of their own. Bramble is an open source app and website that offers any doctor the opportunity to provide their patients that same seamless healthcare experience, regardless of practice size.

### Features for Patients

- **One app for all your doctors**: Instead of multiple fragmented portals with different logins, have all your doctors in one place and only enter your information once
- **No more phone calls or mail**: Communicating with your doctor and paying bills no longer needs to be a game of phone-tag, with the ability to message asynchronously in-app, save your insurance and payment information, and auto-pay. Receive bills as a pdf that you can reference at any time instead of by snail-mail that quickly gets lost.
- **Greater access to doctors**: Many brief but important questions go unasked because they would otherwise require patients to schedule another appointment. With messaging, these questions can be answered and patients can be one step closer to truly preventative care.
- **Transparent availability**: Know exactly which times are available to schedule and reschedule with ease and without needing to make a call.

### Features for Providers

Bramble can immediately elevate any doctor's office to a 21st century healthcare facility, with more seamless communication, easy payment processing, and appointment scheduling.

- **Save administrative time**: Patients can now schedule and reschedule appointments, update their insurance, and make payments without calling in
- **Improve bill payment rates**: A large part of why many medical bills go unpaid isn't lack of funds, but purely the friction involved in doing so. Patients are more likely to pay their bill on time when they can do so in-app with a credit card than if they had to send in a check or give their card information over the phone.
- **Inter-office communication**: With many doctors all on one app, inter-office communication can finally do away with faxes and emails. Messaging between practices can be used to send requests for patient files or to send patient referrals
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Bramble minimizes the number of small gaps in your schedule to help you make the most of your time
